funmatch - match glob-like pattern against string

* pattern is similar to a glob pattern
* string is typically a filename (no directory portions)

For example:

  (funmatch "*.janet" "test.janet")
  # =>
  true

Patterns

* * - zero or more characters (except . if leading part of pattern)
* ? - one character (except . if leading part of pattern)
* [x-y] - one character in the range x <= y
* [!x-y] - one character not in the range x <= y
* [xyz] - one character in the set x, y, ..., z
* [!xyz] - one character not in the set x, y, ..., z

Implementation

The general idea is to:

1. Parse glob-like pattern into pieces (parse-pattern)
2. Create peg from parsed pieces (make-peg)
3. Apply peg/match to a string using the generated peg
